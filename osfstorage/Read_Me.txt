Mean constructs used in the studies have been included in the datafiles for ease, and any reversed items already reversed in the files. For study 3, the variable distancing_av_selfother was used for the main analysis (combination of self other measures). The variables otherdistancing and selfdistancing pertain to the supplementary analyses.

To recreate exclusion criteria use the following variables:
Study 1: Progress >98; answeredprompts = 0; attention_check = 2
Study 2: wordstem_complete = 0; attention_check = 3
Study 3: attentioncheck_false = 24; failed_recall = 0
Study 4: recall_fail = 0; didnotcompleteDVs = 0
